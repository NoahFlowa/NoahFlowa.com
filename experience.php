                My company, OK Enterprises changes names to Osterhout & Klein Enterprises LLC. and operates till August when we sell of clients and
                the partners decide to do other things as lifestyle changes happen after COVID.  Personally, I learned a lot about running a company,
                finding and retaining clients, setting reasonable goals and reaching them as well as the government bureaucracy in opening and closing
                a company.
