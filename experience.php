            <p class="fs-5">
                I am currently pursuing my last semester at Ferris State University for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems.
                I am employed as a Software Developer at SunFrog Solutions making some awesome applications.
                I also love to hang out with my friends in beautiful Traverse City, Michigan and play on my custom built gaming PC.
                Sometimes I dabble in Game Creation with Unreal Engine 5 and even Virtual and Augmented Reality with my Meta Quest 2 and the HTC Vive.

                My company, OK Enterprises changes names to Osterhout & Klein Enterprises LLC. and operates till August when we sell of clients and
                the partners decide to do other things as lifestyle changes happen after COVID.  Personally, I learned a lot about running a company,
                finding and retaining clients, setting reasonable goals and reaching them as well as the government bureaucracy in opening and closing
                a company.

                Along with starting studies at Ferris State University, OK Enterprises enters business officially in the official worst year to make 
                a business.  We still power through to offer services for small and medium businesses which include Application Development such as 
                Web, Mobile and Desktop, as well as other digital creative agency services like Website Design and Development as well as SEO and 
                email marketing.  Also found OK Foundations, an 502 Non Profit, as a way to offer OK Enterprise services for free to struggling 
                businesses due to COVID-19.

                parent company for various ventures for the partners of OK Enterpises.  Chatversity was made as a way to market an application my classmates
                and I made earlier that spring for a capstone project.  Also started work on a semi complete Golfing robot...
